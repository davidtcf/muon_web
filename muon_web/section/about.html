      <h1>About Muons</h1>
      <p>
        Muons are elementary particles similar to electrons, but with a much
        greater mass. They are produced naturally in the upper atmosphere when
        cosmic rays interact with atomic nuclei. Due to their high energy and
        relatively long lifetime, muons can penetrate deep into materials,
        making them useful for scientific research and practical applications.

      <h2>Detection Mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        Muons are typically detected using devices such as scintillation
        counters, drift chambers, or Cherenkov detectors. When a muon passes
        through these detectors, it interacts with the material, producing light
        or electrical signals. These signals are then processed to determine the
        presence, trajectory, and energy of the muon, enabling researchers to
        study their properties and origins.
